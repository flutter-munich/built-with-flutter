# Built with Flutter - Share your Flutter story

## Event Description

> Tuesday, August 6, 2019
>
> RVSP for the event on [`meetup.com/Flutter-Munich/events/260154719`](https://www.meetup.com/Flutter-Munich/events/260154719/).

🏰Have you built something with Flutter? This is the time to show it to the world! This event is focussing on Flutter stories. You can share what you created with Flutter and how your experience was.

🚀We would like to hear about your personal pet projects, your work for a client or your company or open source libraries. The talks should be a good mixture of Flutter, technology, your product or service, your team, an overview of the greatest challenges along the way and a good story. You can share with us why you used Flutter, how you used it and what you built as long as you can do it in 11 minutes.

🎤Would you like to present? Please contact me if you, your company or your team is working on something awesome and using Flutter made shipping something great possible and you would like to share your story with us.

🍻We are going to have 5 short Flutter stories.

👩‍🎓🕺👩‍💻This event will not focus heavily on coding, so feel free to invite your product owner, designer or entrepreneur friends. We have an attendee limit of 150 people. 💃👷💂‍♀️

## Would you like to present?

We are still looking for presentations for this event. If you would like to present, please get in touch on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Flutter-Munich/members/187694864/profile), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vince-varga/) or [email `<vince@serial.dev>`](mailto:vince@serial.dev).

### Guidelines

#### Audience

Though Flutter Munich usually organizes events for software developers, **for this event, we will be reaching out to designers, product owners and everyone who is interested in software development**.

#### Description

If you submit your presentation, please think about the description.

We recommend you include in the description the following:

* The name of the presenter(s). You can present together with someone (e.g. software developer + product owner or designer), in this case, send us the name of every presenters name.
* Your company's, product's or project's name.
* Short description focusing on the product and the team.
* A link to your website or store

#### Talk

*The time limit for your presentation will depend on the number of presentations. You can plan with 10-15 minutes. By 15th July, we will know more and we'll set the time limit then.*

Your audience will be tech-savvy, but not everyone will be a coder, so keep code snippets, more complicated software development concepts at a minimum.

The talks should not be *very* technical, though don't be afraid to mention a couple of problems you are especially proud of solving.

* Explain us why you decided to use Flutter (without bashing other technologies).
* Show us your work: Use screenshots of the real app in your slides or demonstrate your app live.
* Don't include designs in your slides that you are only *planning* to implement in Flutter but haven't actually implement yet.
* Tell how your experience was with Flutter: you can talk about code, development experience, team structure, processes, anything you think is relevant.
* Tell us what you liked and disliked while developing your app.
* Communicate clearly whether the product is already launched. Tell us when you plan to launch it. If you have apps available on Apple's App Store on Google Play Store, don't forget to include them in you talk.

*If you'd like to talk about your code in detail or you'd like to present a topic that's only interesting for software developers, you can present at any of our other [upcoming events](https://www.meetup.com/Flutter-Munich/events/)*
